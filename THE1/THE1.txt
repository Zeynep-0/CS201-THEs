Your task is to develop a C++ program that calculates the required boiling time and
adjusted boiling point for three distinct magical potions. Each potion has unique
ingredients that affect the boiling point and volume of the potion mixture. Your 
program will guide the user through the process of brewing one of three
potions: the Potion of Invisibility, the Calming Draught, or the Strengthening
Solution. Each potion requires a specific combination of magical ingredients that
alter the potion's boiling point. Additionally, you must calculate the boiling time
required to evaporate the potion mixture to a desired final volume, ensuring the
potion's efficacy.
